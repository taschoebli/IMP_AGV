## Navigation for IMP_AGV

---

The main components include:

1. The individual [environment](env.example) is represented nodes (x,y) and edges that a path can be constituted
2. The [Navigator](Navigator.py) module is able to 
   - find path to resolve task
   - (*maybe*) identify congested areas and find alternative route
